# Disseration Project 2021
## Aim
My research consisted of comparing traditional vs. digital (unplugged vs. plugged) methods of teaching KS1 Computing.

## Application
I asked a small pool of teachers to use the application and provide feedback on how they believed their pupils would engage with it and how much they would learn from it.
